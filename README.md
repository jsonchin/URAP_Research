Fall 2016 UC Berkeley Research Visualizations

Examples of d3.js being used to visualize circulation data of magazines. The time series allows for dynamic creation of overlayed line charts for effective comparisons and the choropleth also shows the change over time of the distribution of magazine circulation.

I love d3.js, it's so beautiful :)

Examples of both can be seen [here](https://dustcarrier.github.io/).
